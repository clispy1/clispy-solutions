        bio: "I began my journey as an Electrical Engineer, right from college. After a while, I got curious about the digital world and started learning about it. I started as a graphic designer, and later switched into web development and design. 2 years later, I founded Clispy Solutions to provide my design and development services. And as a side hustle, I founded and run a preorder dropshipping online store â€” 'CLISPY.STORE'",
